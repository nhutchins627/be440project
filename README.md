This code is used to create a dimension reduction plot of the axolotl injury recovery data to identify novel cell type populations. 

Data: The data used was a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) set available from the publication DOI: 10.1126/science.aaq0681 and the Genome Ascenion Viewer at 
GSE106269. The gene matrix of counts of genes by cell ID is available in .csv form. There is currently only one file the aaq0681_TableS5.csv which is a
matrix of counts of the gene expression by cell ID of the scRNAseq dataset available for the uninjured axolotl upper arm connective tissue.
